in this code there is a thing that first it asks for the number or name and when the customer's name is entered it sends backend api to get the customer's data like location stuff. but i want that there is also an option to search from the building like a slider radio button or something else that will allow us to toggle like find by user or by location in this it is find by customer so i want to add a fuctionality that it will also be search by location where we add add location number or name or whatever and select the desired location and if it is vacant it will ask for adding user. i think everything is fine we just need to keep the location btn stuff etc enabled and there we can select location as it is doing right now but after that if the location is vacant we have to assign it to a user and i think new api should be created in the backend rn the apis are good here. main goal is to achieve the functionality of assigning the location if the location is vacant and if not vacant it will take that customer id and rest remains the same. making sure complaint launches the same way. like api stuff of launching complaints etc. no think deeply and tell me where do i replace what.
